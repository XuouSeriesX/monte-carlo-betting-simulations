    Risk of ruin is a concept in gambling, insurance, and finance relating to 
    the likelihood of losing all one's investment capital[1] or extinguishing 
    one's bankroll below the minimum for further play. For instance, if someone 
    bets all their money on a simple coin toss, the risk of ruin is 50%. In a 
    multiple-bet scenario, risk of ruin accumulates with the number of bets: 
    each repeated play increases the risk, and persistent play ultimately 
    yields the stochastic certainty of gambler's ruin.

    Formula: risk_of_ruin = ((1 â€“ Edge)/(1 + Edge)) ^ Capital_Units
        or
    Formula: Risk of Ruin = ((1 - (W - L)) / (1 + (W - L)))^U
        Where:
            W = the probability of a desirable outcome, or a win
            L = the probability of an undesirable outcome, or a loss
            U = the maximum number of risks that can be taken before the 
                individual reaches their threshold for ruin
